  - **PvP (Player vs Player)** ‚Äì Two players compete against each other on the same keyboard.
  
  - **PvE (Player vs Environment)** ‚Äì The player competes against an AI-controlled car. The AI uses simple movement logic to chase and intercept the ball.

- Each player controls a car and tries to hit the ball into the opponent‚Äôs goal.

- The ball will bounce and react realistically using 2D physics.

- Cars accelerate gradually while holding the movement keys and can perform short boosts for faster speed.
